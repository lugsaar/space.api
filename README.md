# space.api

The [Space API](https://spaceapi.io/) endpoint for the Linux User Group Saar, shows the current status of the space, in the future possibly also information like the room temperature etc.
Our space.api is a kind of MQTT2space.api bridge, so we are very flexible to connect new devices as indicators to the API in our spaces. The status but also for example the temperature etc.
can be transmitted very easy by an ESP8266 to the API.  

More information on the usage, installation and examples will follow shortly after we have tested everything properly.   

## Usage

Have a look at the example folder, where you will find a simple JavaScript to add the status to your web page.
